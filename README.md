# Light Swirl ThreeJS Experiment

The initial inspiration for this project came from seeing some corrugated metal walls reflecting different color lights from different angles.

The featured shape was generated from a python Blender script written many years ago, seen in the [reference](./reference) folder. The code references the now-defunct self-authored [play-svg](https://github.com/justin-hackin/play-svg).

This project is an experimental playground for the learnings acquired in [ThreeJS Journey](https://threejs-journey.com) course.
